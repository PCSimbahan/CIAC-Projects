First Project is the Google Sheets Reminder System re: OPCEO Directives Tracker, wherein I was tasked to make a reminder system the sends a one-time email to remind them that a document/project pending is due today.
Due date is evaluated against the date today and its status. If pending, send an email, if complete, ignore.

The second version of the reminder system is implemented within the google sheets environment as well but this time, within the OPCEO Documents Tracker; This worksheet has multiple pages. The challenge was to make the code read and affect only one page. The reminder frequency should set to be weekly instead of daily.

The third Project is a timestamp script that automatically captures the time, and encode it automatically on the target cell when you enter a document name. The time should not update unless you do so.
