First Project is the Google Sheets Reminder System re: OPCEO Directives Tracker, wherein I was tasked to make a reminder system the sends a one-time email to remind them that a document/project pending is due today.
Due date is evaluated against the date today and its status. If pending, send an email, if complete, ignore.
